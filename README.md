## How does it work
The current state of the world can bring you down, lessen your self-esteem, develop feelings of loneliness...

Our goal with our platform is to get you working on building up your confidence, relax you in terms of user experience and gets you more and more in a feeling of control of yourself and your mental health. Our target segment of users will be users that experience anxiety or want to improve their everyday life from the ages of 18 to 30 years old, but other ages might enjoy using our application as well.

We are exploring the idea of having a guided meditation just like mindfulness, breathing exercises.

From our experience anxiety manifests less and less when we keep ourselves busy, organized and productive so we are looking to implement some organization tools, tailored suggestions of new activities, and have ways of measuring and showing progress possibly in form of a mood tracker so you can be proud of what you've accomplished.
